Project Overview: AI-Assisted Melody Generation Using A* Search Algorithm

This project presents an AI-driven system designed to generate structured and harmonically consistent melodies using the A* search algorithm. 
The primary goal is to automate the melody composition process by combining music theory with intelligent search techniques, enabling users—both musicians and non-musicians—to create original melodies with minimal effort.

At its core, the system allows users to define musical parameters such as the starting note, melody length, key signature, and note range. Based on these inputs, the A* algorithm searches for an optimal sequence of notes, guided by a harmony cost heuristic that favors smooth transitions and musical consonance. The algorithm operates within dynamically generated chord progressions, ensuring that the melody aligns with harmonic rules.

In addition to generating melodies, the system provides practical outputs: a visual graph showing the pitch progression of the melody and a downloadable MIDI file that can be used in digital audio workstations (DAWs) for further music production. The implementation also supports the generation of multiple melodies in a single session, offering a flexible and interactive experience.

This project demonstrates how AI techniques can support creative processes by producing musically coherent outputs that follow human-like logic. While it excels in generating simple to moderately complex melodies, it also lays a strong foundation for future enhancements, such as incorporating machine learning models to handle more nuanced musical structures and styles.
